SMU looks forward to welcoming students, faculty and staff for the upcoming fall academic semester next month. Preparations continue for a safe return to regular operations, in-person instruction and full campus activities. However, it is important to balance the desire to embrace a traditional college setting with the need to maintain healthy behaviors to keep the virus spread under control.  

Faculty may require masks

Masks will not be required at SMU for fall 2021, with a few exceptions. Individuals will continue to have the option to wear a mask anywhere and at any time on campus if they choose.

After reviewing the latest guidance from federal, state and local health authorities, as well as input from the University’s Emergency Operations Center, SMU’s Faculty Senate Executive Committee and the President’s Executive Council, SMU will allow faculty members to seek an exception to the campus no-mask policy in their classrooms through a process that includes advance notice to their department chairs, deans and the provost’s office. Instructors must clearly define their classroom mask requirements and how they will be enforced in the course syllabuses prior to the start of classes. The provost’s office will provide more details on the classroom mask exception in the coming weeks.
