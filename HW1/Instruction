CS 3342 – Homework #1  
Due Date: September 18, 2022 (Sunday) - 11:59pm 

Part A:  Regular Expression – with Java  
You can use IntelliJ\Eclipse\VS Code for this homework.  If you forget how to write a Java 
program, you can Google it or watch Some useful YouTube videos like the following:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cejX8YuCfNw  
Part A1: 
Run the following Java code snippet. Take a screen shot of the output and copy it to a Word 
doc.  
 
Part A2: 
Replace the character (#) with a RegEx metacharacter or quantifier in the Java code snippet 
below to make the Boolean output to be ‘true’.  Take a screenshot of your code snippet and 
the output and copy them to a Word doc. 
 
 
 
 
 
Note: you may need to import some Java classes highlighted below to your Java program: 
package com.proglang; 
import java.util.regex.Matcher; 
import java.util.regex.Pattern; 
public class hw1 { 
 public static void main(String[] args) { 
  //Part A: 
  System.out.println("Match 1: " + Pattern.matches("[789][0-9]{9}", 
"99530389490")); 
  ........... 
  ........... 
 } 
} 
 
 
*Note – your task:  Submit the Word doc and the source code separately to Canvas.  You can 
zip the source code but do not zip the Word doc.   (Name your word doc - 
‘HW1_partA_your_name.docx’.) 
 
 
Part B:  Regular Expression – with Python 
 
You can run Python in Visual Studio Code or other IDEs/IDLEs you like.   
Steps to run Python in Visual Studio Code: 
 
1.  Install VS Code on Windows/Mac:  
(Download Visual Studio Code - Mac, Linux, Windows )

Part B task: Replace the character (#) in the following Python code snippet to make the code 
work as described in their corresponding print statements.   Take a screenshot of your code 
snippet and the output and copy them to a Word doc.   
 
#Regular Expression  
#Sample RE Python code  
import re 
def text_match(text): 
        patterns = r'ab\w+' 
        if re.search(patterns,  text): 
                return (patterns, text, 'Found a match!') 
        else: 
                return (patterns, text, 'Not matched!') 
 
print("Text1:", text_match("Cats are smarter than dogs")) 
print("Text2:", text_match("abc")) 
 
# The following is the code to modify. 
# Open file (please download the sample input file from Canvas.) 
f = open('D:\\test1.txt', 'r') 
data=f.read() 
strings = re.findall("mask.", data) 
#case sensitive 
print ("Search1: mask or masks", strings)   
strings = re.findall(r'##for###', data) 
print ("Search2: words start with 'for': ", strings) 
strings = re.findall(r'###ies\b', data) 
print ("Search3: words end with 'ies': ", strings) 
strings = re.findall(r'#########', data) 
print ("Search4: words begin with 'i' and end with 't': ", strings) 
 
Sample output for replacing ‘#” in findall: 
Text1: ('ab\\w+', 'Cats are smarter than dogs', 'Not matched!') 
Text2: ('ab\\w+', 'abc', 'Found a match!') 
Search1: mask or masks ['masks', 'mask ', 'mask ', 'mask ', 'mask '] 
Search2: words start with 'for':  ['forward', 'for', 'for', 'for'] 
Search3: words end with 'ies':  ['activities', 'authorities'] 
Search4: words begin with 'i' and end with 't':  ['it', 'important', 'input'] 
 
Notes: 
Search1: mask or masks ['masks', 'mask ', 'mask ', 'mask ', 'mask '] 
Search2: words start with 'for':  ['forward', 'for', 'for', 'for'] 
Search3: words end with 'ies':  ['activities', 'authorities'] 
Search4: words begin with 'i' and end with 't':  ['it', 'important', 'input'] 
 
*Submit the Word doc and the source code separately to Canvas. (Name your word doc - 
‘HW1_partB_your_name.docx’.) 
 
 
The following is the content of the input file (test1.txt): 
SMU looks forward to welcoming students, faculty and staff for the upcoming fall academic 
semester next month. Preparations continue for a safe return to regular operations, in-person 
instruction and full campus activities. However, it is important to balance the desire to 
embrace a traditional college setting with the need to maintain healthy behaviors to keep the 
virus spread under control.   
 
Faculty may require masks 
 
Masks will not be required at SMU for fall 2021, with a few exceptions. Individuals will 
continue to have the option to wear a mask anywhere and at any time on campus if they 
choose. 
 
After reviewing the latest guidance from federal, state and local health authorities, as well as 
input from the University’s Emergency Operations Center, SMU’s Faculty Senate Executive 
Committee and the President’s Executive Council, SMU will allow faculty members to seek an 
exception to the campus no-mask policy in their classrooms through a process that includes 
advance notice to their department chairs, deans and the provost’s office. Instructors must 
clearly define their classroom mask requirements and how they will be enforced in the course 
syllabuses prior to the start of classes. The provost’s office will provide more details on the 
classroom mask exception in the coming weeks.
